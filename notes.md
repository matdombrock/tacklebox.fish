fishfinder is a good name for seer. It can be shorted to ff. 
This is the most useful command so far and the name fits well
But then what is fishfinder now called?
Fish launcher? Just call it tacklebox? tbox? reel?
tbox is the best even if the main repo is called tacklebox


Does it make more sense to expect users to do something like:

alias mytool='bash /path/to/mytool.sh'

or to have them source a function like:
source /path/to/mytool.sh
